KMSpico is the most successful, frequently updated and 100% clean tool to permanently activate any version of Windows or Microsoft office within matter of seconds.

“KMS” (Key Management Service) is a technology used by Microsoft to activate software deployed in bulk (e.g., in a corporate environment). What KMSpico does is to replace the installed key with a volume license key, create an emulated instance of a KMS server on your machine (or in previous iterations of the software, search for KMS servers online) and force the products to activate against this KMS server.

KMS activation only lasts for 180 days after which, it must be activated again. However, by using KMSpico, an activation service is created which runs KMSpico twice a day to reset this counter.
